    <h2>First Steps into Programming</h2>
    <p><strong>Published on:</strong> March 26, 2025 | <strong>Tags:</strong> #programming #python #beginners</p>
    <p>Hello everyone! This is my first blog post as a Computer Science Engineering student. I'm excited to share my learning journey and experiences with you all.</p>
    <p>Recently, I started learning Python. It's been a fascinating experience so far. The syntax is quite intuitive, and I've already written a few simple programs.</p>
    <p>I'm looking forward to diving deeper into different programming concepts and exploring various areas within computer science.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
    <p><strong>Published on:</strong> March 20, 2025 | <strong>Tags:</strong> #datastructures #algorithms #csfundamentals</p>
    <p>This week, I've been focusing on the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms. It's amazing how these concepts form the backbone of efficient software development.</p>
    <p>Learning about arrays, linked lists, and different sorting algorithms has been challenging yet rewarding. I'm starting to appreciate how choosing the right data structure can significantly impact a program's performance.</p>
    <p>I'm planning to practice more problems on platforms like LeetCode to solidify my understanding.</p>

    <h2>Exploring Web Development with HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p><strong>Published on:</strong> March 15, 2025 | <strong>Tags:</strong> #webdevelopment #html #css</p>
    <p>Beyond the core programming concepts, I've also started exploring the world of web development. Building simple web pages using HTML and CSS is quite satisfying.</p>
    <p>It's fascinating to see how these technologies work together to create the websites we use every day. I'm currently learning about different HTML tags and CSS properties to style web elements.</p>
    <p>This blog itself is a result of my initial foray into HTML!</p>
